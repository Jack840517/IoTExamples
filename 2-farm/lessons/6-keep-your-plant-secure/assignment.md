# Build a new IoT device

## Instructions

Over the last 6 lessons you have learned about digital agriculture and how to use IoT devices to gather data to predict plant growth, and automate watering based off soil moisture readings.

Use what you have learned to build a new IoT device using a sensor and actuator or your choice. Send telemetry to an IoT Hub, and use that to control an actuator via serverless code. You can use a sensor and an actuator you have already used in this or the previous project, or if you have other hardware try something new.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Code an IoT device to use a sensor and actuator | Coded an IoT device that works with a sensor and actuator | Coded an IoT device that works with a sensor or an actuator | Was unable code an IoT device to use a sensor or an actuator |
| Connect the IoT device to IoT Hub | Was able to deploy an IoT Hub and send telemetry to it, and receive commands from it | Was able to deploy an IoT Hub and either send telemetry or receive commands | Was unable to deploy an IoT Hub and communicate with it from an IoT device |
| Control the actuator using serverless code | Was able to deploy an Azure Function to control the device triggered by telemetry events | Was able to deploy an Azure Function triggered by telemetry events but was unable to control the actuator | Was unable to deploy an Azure Function |
