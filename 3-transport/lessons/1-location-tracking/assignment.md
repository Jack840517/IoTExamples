# Investigate other GPS data

## Instructions

The NMEA sentences that come from your GPS sensor have other data in addition to location. Investigate the additional data, and use it in your IoT device.

For example - can you get the current date and time? If you are using a microcontroller, can you set the clock using GPS data in the same way you set is using NTP signals in the previous project? Can you get elevation (your height above sea level), or your current speed?

If you are using a virtual IoT device, then you can get some of this data by sending NMEA sentences generated using tools [nmeagen.org](https://www.nmeagen.org).

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Get more GPS data | Is able to get and use more GPS data, either as telemetry or to set up the IoT device | Is able to get more GPS data, but is unable to use it | Is unable to get more GPS data |
