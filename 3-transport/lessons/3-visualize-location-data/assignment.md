# Deploy your app

## Instructions

There are several ways that you can deploy your app so that you can share it with the world, including using GitHub pages or using one of many service providers. A really excellent way to do this is to use Azure Static Web Apps. In this assignment, build your web app and deploy it to the cloud by following [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli) or watching [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADVGIXciYn8&list=PLlrxD0HtieHgMPeBaDQFx9yNuFxx6S1VG&index=3).
A benefit of using Azure Static Web Apps is that you can hide any API keys in the portal, so take this opportunity to refactor your subscriptionKey as a variable and store it in the cloud.
