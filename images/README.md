# Images

The images in the [icons](icons) folder are from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) and require attribution. Each image lists the required attribution. These images should be used for any diagram that needs them to keep imagery consistent.

The [Diagrams.sketch](Diagrams.sketch) file is a [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) document containing all the diagrams used in the lessons and projects. If you are involved in a translation, please also translate these by either copying and updating the document, or by providing a list of the words you need translated as a GitHub issue.

The rest of the images are used throughout the lessons and projects.
