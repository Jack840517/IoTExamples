# Compare domains

## Instructions

When you created your object detector, you had a choice of multiple domains. Compare how well they work for your stock detector, and describe which gives better results.

To change the domain, select the **Settings** button on the top menu, select a new domain, select the **Save changes** button, then retrain the model. Make sure you test with the new iteration of the model trained with the new domain.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Train the model with a different domain | Was able to change the domain and re-train the model | Was able to change the domain and re-train the model | Was unable to change the domain or re-train the model |
| Test the model and compare the results | Was able to test the model with different domains, compare results, and describe which is better | Was able to test the model with different domains, but was unable to compare the results and describe which is better | Was unable to test the model with different domains |
