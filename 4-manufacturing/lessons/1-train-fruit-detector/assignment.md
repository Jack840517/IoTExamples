# Train your classifier for multiple fruits and vegetables

## Instructions

In this lesson you trained an image classifier to be able to distinguish between ripe and unripe fruits, but only using one type of fruit. A classifier can be trained to recognize multiple fruits, with varying rates of success depending on the type of fruit and the difference between ripe and unripe.

For example, with fruits that change color when they ripen, image classifiers might be less effective than a color sensor as they usually work on grey scale images instead of full color.

Train your classifier with other fruits to see how well it works, especially when fruits look similar. For example, apples and tomatoes.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Train the classifier for multiple fruits | Was able to train the classifier for multiple fruits | Was able to train the classifier for one additional fruit | Was unable to train the classifier for more fruits |
| Determine how well the classifier works | Was able to comment correctly on how well the classifier worked with different fruits | Was able to observe and offer suggestions as to how well it was working | Was unable to comment on how well the classifier worked |
