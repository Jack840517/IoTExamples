# Recommended learning model

For the most effective learning outcomes, **we recommend a “Flipped Model" approach** like science labs: students work on projects during class time, with opportunities for discussion, Q&A, and project assistance, and do the lecture elements as pre-reads on their own time.

## Why Flipped Learning?

1. This mode of instruction engages a variety of learning methods – visual, auditory, hands-on, problem solving, etc.[[1]](#references)
2. Flipped classrooms have shown to increase focus, engagement, motivation, self-sufficiency, knowledge retention, and communication (both teacher-to-student and student-to-student).[[2,3]](#references)
3. As instructors, you can spend more time with struggling students while allowing more advanced learners the freedom to work ahead.[[4]](#references)

We also recommend instructors assume the role of **“Co-Facilitator"** who learns alongside and supports students as they work through questions and explorations driven by their own interests and insights.

There’s no “right way" to do something here. At times, you won’t have all the answers. Some students may not get through all the projects. Your goal is to help your students arrive organically at ways to problem solve that may be more playful, collaborative, or self-directed than what they originally expected.

## Helpful Facilitation Tips:

* Reflect on what you notice, ask questions, and make observations.
* Use phrases like “I notice…" and “I wonder…"
* Connect students who are struggling with those who have already found solutions.
* Point at components and parts or make suggestions about different things to try if a student is stuck. Ask the student to change one thing at a time and observe what happens.
* Acknowledge frustration and recognize effort.
* Avoid building or coding for the students, except where students need physical assistance.

## Sample Facilitation Language:

* “Ask two others before you ask me."
* “Spend another two minutes trying…"
* “Let’s try taking a break from this. Maybe you could help other students with their electrical connections since you already figured that out?"
* “I wonder if another student has had the same problem. Let’s check!"
* "You really committed to this and figured it out! Could I send others to you for help with this?"
* “That’s odd, it doesn’t make sense to me, either. Maybe we could ask another student, or if you figure it out could you share with the class?"
